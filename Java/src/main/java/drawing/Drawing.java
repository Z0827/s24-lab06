// For the first one: 1. just take all of the inner content out and make them as a new function.
// 2. make this an abstract class with implementation of those inner contents. Probably have implementation
// of JPEGDrawing, PNGdrwaing, and they extends it with different Writer.
// 3. Take this function to JPEGWriter and PNGWriter with one more parameter "this.shapes"

// For the second one: 1. The shape should not take this lines parameter. It can just work with it
// as it is a private field. Maybe shape should be an abstract class.
// 2. Make the Shape and its implementation to a composite pattern. This works
